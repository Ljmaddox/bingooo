Let me finish my point.
That's not what I said.
If I may interject...
We need to look at the facts.
I respectfully disagree.
The data clearly shows...
You're taking that out of context.
Let's stay on topic.
This is a critical issue.
I think we can all agree...
That's a false equivalence.
Let me clarify.
The real question is...
You're misrepresenting my argument.
This is about the future.
We need to address the root cause.
That's simply not true.
I hear what you're saying, but...
Let's focus on the evidence.
This is a matter of principle.
We need to have an honest conversation.
That's a strawman argument.
I think you're oversimplifying.
The American people deserve better.
This is not a partisan issue.
We need to come together.
That's a distraction.
The stakes are too high.
This is about accountability.
Let's not lose sight of the bigger picture.
I think we can find common ground.
That's a slippery slope.
We need to take a step back.
This is about fairness.
You're ignoring the facts.
Let's be clear about this.
This is not just my opinion.
We need to move forward.
That's a red herring.
This is about trust.
I think you're conflating two issues.
We need to hold people accountable.
This is about transparency.
You're making assumptions.
Let's stick to the issue at hand.
This is about leadership.
We need to think long-term.
That's an ad hominem attack.
This is about integrity.
You're dodging the question.
We need to find a solution.
